    30 hours

4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?
Future students should be careful to note where their paths are going for things like images.  I spent a long time trying to figure out why my images that had the path ../img weren't working, and it took me a while to figure out that we needed to do ./img
