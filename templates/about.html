	<p>Hi! My name is Julian Bossiere and I'm currently an undergraduate student at University of Washington, working towards a BS in Informatics - the study of people, technology and information.</p>

	<h2 class="about-body">Skills</h2>
	<p>Currently, I'm developing my skills in both design and coding. I've learned how to build mobile-first, dynamic, and responsive websites/web apps using my design thinking skills in combination with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I've accomplished this by utilizing frameworks such as Bootstrap 3 and AngularJS, and libraries like jQuery/AJAX.</p>

	<p>This year, I'm looking forward to also learning about using data structures and algorithms in Java, server-side web development, and databases.</p>

	<h2 class="about-body">Other Interests</h2>
	<p>Besides coding and design, I'm passionate about music. I love to sing, and play piano and guitar. I mostly play cover songs by my favorite musicians, but I've also been trying to get into songwriting. I also enjoy learning foreign languages. I speak Japanese fluently, and I'm studying Korean at school.  Being half-Japanese and living in Japan for part of my life, I've grown up in a mix of cultures, and this has added to my appreciation of foreign languages (and in extension, coding languages) and culture.</p>
